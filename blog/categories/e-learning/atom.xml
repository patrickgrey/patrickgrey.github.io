    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#39;m currently developing a lot of Adobe Edge Animate (EA) compositions for e-learning modules. They will ultimately be deployed to a Learning Content Management System (LCMS) but I need a way to quickly review content as I develop it. EA lets you preview in the browser but I like to see content in context so I need to be able to step through different pages and topics within a module. I also like to have live-reload as I code ;-)</p>

<p>This post outlines what I use and the steps I go through to set up a really nice workflow.</p>

<p>I use the <a href="http://yeoman.io">yeoman.io</a> webapp generator to create a simple false module with navigation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a project folder and a module folder within that.</li>
<li>Right click on module and open gitbash console at that location.</li>
<li>Update webapp generator using <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go"> npm install -g generator-webapp </span>
</code></pre></div> (update doesn&#39;t always seem to work for me - must post issue on github).</li>
<li>Scaffold the project using the generator: <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go"> yo webapp </span>
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>I don&#39;t need Bootstrap but select sass/compass and modernizr.</li>
<li>Once the scaffolding is finished, I run it: <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go"> grunt serve </span>
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>In the app folder, I add a folder called &quot;topics&quot;. Within this I have topic folders; &quot;t1&quot;, &quot;t2&quot;, etc.</li>
<li>I add my custom index page that includes an iframe linking to pages in the topics folder and navigation buttons.</li>
<li>Navigation is controlled via a simple JSON model in index.html</li>
<li>Now I can add new pages and build the module in context with the benefits of live-reload as I go.</li>
<li>Next I set the project up as a git repository so I have version control: <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go"> git init </span>
</code></pre></div> on the module folder.</li>
<li>I create a repo on github or (more often with projects for clients) a private repo on bitbucket.</li>
<li>Then add the remote repo to the local one, add the files, commit and push <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="console"><span class="go"> git remote add origin https://patrickgrey@bitbucket.org/patrickgrey/ians2014fam.git</span>
<span class="go">git add -A</span>
<span class="go">git commit -m &amp;quot;Scaffolding files created&amp;quot;</span>
<span class="go">git push -u origin master </span>
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>I customise the Gruntfile.js a little for my own needs e.g. the topics folder needs to be copied to distribution and I comment out HTML compression task as I like to be able to read the output.</li>
<li>Finally, I open the module folder in Sublime Text and save it as a project. I add the project files to the .gitignore file.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;d be happy to send anyone a copy of the navigation files, which you are free to use in any way you like. Just get in touch.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The objective of ATFCM is to optimise traffic flows according to air traffic control capacity while enabling airlines to operate safe and efficient flights. I was asked to review  an existing ATFCM course and translate the content into a tablet friendly format.</p>

<p>This was the first course Eurocontrol commissioned that was developed entirely with Adobe Edge Animate, making the content accessible to devices that don&#39;t support Flash.</p>

<p>You can try this course by registering with the <a href="https://trainingzone.eurocontrol.int/" title="Open the Eurocontrol LMS website in a new window." target="_blank">Eurocontrol LMS</a> and looking in the catalogue for &quot;ATFCM&quot;.</p>

<p>This was a great learning experience for me, I really got to grips with Edge, discovered its many quirks and built up many assets that will be reusable in future.</p>

<p>For Eurocontrol it was a great opportunity to see how new forms of content would integrate with their LCMS. It is also an opportunity to measure interest from devices that previously wouldn&#39;t be able to access the content.</p>

<p>It was exciting to be present at the start of a new development era for such a large organisation.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I like to keep clients informed of the latest trends in e-learning and general web development. In 2013 Eurocontrol were still developing content in Flash and their systems were all based around desktop delivery. I suggested they needed to urgently start thinking about catering for non-desktop devices.</p>

  <figcaption>Mobile learning is increasingly important.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As a result, they asked me to put together a strategy paper stating the reasons a change should be made and how that change could be brought about.</p>

<p>My recommendations were adopted and the organisation is now moving towards a &#39;future-friendly&#39; approach to e-learning development.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I was asked to produce reports evaluating the current LCMS for its mobile capabilities and Adobe Edge as a development tool to replace Flash. Adobe Edge is now being used for all major animated and interactive content development.</p>

    <link href="/blog/case-study/e-learning/2014/01/11/case-elearning-acdm.html"/>
    <updated>2014-01-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>/blog/case-study/e-learning/2014/01/11/case-elearning-acdm</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the largest course I have completed single-handedly. It contains over 10 hours of learning. I was tasked with educational design, technical design and development (including editing several hours of video footage) and deployment.</p>

<p>A-CDM is is a common sense idea that is being introduced to airports internationally.</p>

<p>There is a lot of data about flight contained across many different systems at airports. Up until recently, that data was not being shared as much as it could be. A-CDM introduces guidance and processes to allow different airport professions share more of their data. This results in a much more efficient transit from landing to departure and can reduce delays.</p>

<p>You can try this course by registering with the <a href="https://trainingzone.eurocontrol.int/" title="Open the Eurocontrol LMS website in a new window.">Eurocontrol LMS</a> and looking in the catalogue for &quot;CDM&quot;.</p>

<p>This was an interesting challenge to take on. I was subcontracted by the Subject Matter Experts, <a href="http://www.integra.dk/" title="Open the Eurocontrol LMS website in a new window.">Integra</a>, who had won the contract to develop an e-learning course for A-CDM. They had already hired a company to produce the e-learning but, after several months, they were unable to deliver the content. Integra and Eurocontrol were left with very little digital content and completely unsuitable storyboards.</p>

<p>My first action was to inform my clients that, in my opinion, their course could not be delivered in the timescale they were aiming at. I had reviewed the existing storyboard and judged that it would need to be completely rewritten before any content could be created.</p>

<p>Happily the clients agreed with the new course of action and work got under way. As well as designing an entirely new storyboard with the SME, I designed and developed the course LMS navigation, all graphics and all animations. I also filmed over 5 hours of interviews, edited them and integrated them into a custom Flash video player I had built.</p>

<p>After a year of six day weeks, some long nights and enough coffee to fill a loch, the course was launched on time and on budget.</p>
